Measurements of each craterâ€™s area, perimeter, major and minor axis to produce dimensionless shape parameters of aspect ratio 
and isoperimetric circularity. A statistical population to establish quantitative parameters for secondary crater shape in a 
2D data set was created and analyzed. The method to explicate these diversities include separating various crater shapes into 
three distinguishable categories: (A) highest continuous rim, (B) depressions interrupted by a convex arc from an overprinted 
crater (C) multi-basin cases containing complied features from category (A) and (B).

The long-term goal of this research is to provide a catalog of data that establishes the quantitative diversity of secondary 
impact craters to distinguish them from small primary impacts, small volcanic vents, and collapsed features found on the Moon
and Mars. 

This routine accepts the applicable data to analyze each class of secondary impact craters laid out in the methodology of this
project and generates a scatter plot displaying the isoperimetric circularity and aspect ratio of all features at both sites.
